## INTRODUCTION

Instead of learning big methodologies [...] focus on practices. [...] You can become an expert in a
practice without being an expert in a complete methodology.
— Ivar Jacobson
This project is about skills desirable of a software engineer to develop proficiency and
excel in a particular area in software engineering for the 21st century as given by
SWEBOK and/or SWECOM.
The project will involve conducting certain activities and creating a set of artifacts based
on those activities.
In the rest of the document, ‘SESTOPIA’ (a neologistic portmanteau of software engineer
skills utopia) stands for the name of both the project and the product, unless otherwise
stated.
SESTOPIA will be an information-intensive Web Application. SESTOPIA should, in
principle, be accessible to anybody, anywhere, using any interactive device connected to
the Internet.
SESTOPIA must follow the Design Thinking process. The process must be
documented.
SESTOPIA must have a theme that is unique across the class. (Web Applications for
different domains are recognized by their unique themes.)
There must be a design model for SESTOPIA. This model could be represented using
CRC cards, the Unified Modeling Language (UML), or the Interaction Flow
Modeling Language (IFML).
SESTOPIA must be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client-side,
and JavaScript or PHP on the server-side. The use of these Web technologies must be
such that it is aligned with the software engineering principles of separation of
concerns and modularity. For example, this could be done by an appropriate responsive
design and modular CSS.

## SESTOPIA must be navigable and searchable.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP used in SESTOPIA must be valid. (In this context,
“validation” means conformance to the specification. An IDE may or may not be
sufficient for validation. A Web user agent is insufficient to check for validation. Each of
these must at least pass the corresponding lint programs.)
SESTOPIA must provide support for error handling.
SESTOPIA must aim for error messages to be helpful.
The reuse of experiential knowledge any type in the development of SESTOPIA is
encouraged, but must be acknowledged explicitly. The types of reuse could include
principles, guidelines, patterns, frameworks, libraries, and so on.
The repetition (redundancy) of any type in the development of SESTOPIA is
discouraged. (This is aligned with “Once and Only Once”.)
The use of any tools in the development of SESTOPIA is encouraged, but must be
acknowledged explicitly.
In its support for accessibility, SESTOPIA must conform to either Section 508 or
WCAG 2.0 Level AA.
SESTOPIA must be hosted globally and publicly. (There are several Web Hosting
Services available at no cost.)
